# TodoItems List

An Android exercise for developers teaching how to play around with RecyclerView and Adapter

## Question:

We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a description on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?

In your response notice the following:
1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage? (for example, 
    a glowing button is more discoverable then a swipe-left gesture)
2. how hard to implement will your solution be?
3. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?

## Answers:

To add editing capability, I would add a small button to each item with an informative drawing of 
a pencil. From the user's point of view, it is very clear that clicking on a pencil will give 
access to edit the text. For the programmer (me), implementing another button is not a complex 
problem or difficulty. All you have to do is allow access to the text, and this happens anyway in 
the main activity.
As far as the Android world is concerned, drawing a pencil is acceptable in order to mark an edit, 
however usually the marking does not appear on each item individually. Directly clicking on the 
text to edit it might be more intuitive and "pretty" to the user, but I guess it would be a 
little more complicated for me (maybe?).

## Submission:

I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence.  
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.
